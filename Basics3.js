//var x : it means declaration of a variable.

//Declaration: When you write var x;, JavaScript "declares/creates" the variable x before running the code, meaning it reserves space for it in memory. This is called "hoisting."

//Hoisting: Even though you declare x later in the code, JavaScript moves the declaration to the top in memory (hoisting), but not the value.

//Result: Before you assign a value (x = 5), JavaScript knows x exists but doesnâ€™t know its value, so console.log(x) shows undefined.

//The declaration part is: var x; This is the part where the variable x is declared (created). It is hoisted to the top by JavaScript, so the variable x exists in memory before the code runs.

//Hoisting Behavior: When you declare a variable with var, the declaration is hoisted to the top of its containing function or global scope, but the initialization happens where it appears in the code.

//Access Before Initialization: If you try to access the variable before its initialization, it returns undefined because the variable exists but hasn't been assigned a value yet.

//var does not have this restriction, which is why it gives undefined instead of an error.

console.log(x); // Output: undefined (because the declaration is hoisted)
var x = 5; // Declaration is hoisted, but initialization happens here

//=================================================================

//let:
//Hoisting Behavior: The declaration of a let variable is also hoisted, but it is not initialized until the code execution reaches the line where the variable is declared.

//Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ): If you try to access the variable before its declaration, it falls into the "Temporal Dead Zone," leading to a ReferenceError.

console.log(x); // Throws ReferenceError
let x = 5; // Declaration is hoisted, but cannot be accessed until this line

//================================================================

var x; // Declaration is hoisted to the top
console.log(x); // Output: undefined (because x is declared but not yet initialized)
x = 5; // Initialization happens here
